1. Clean the beaker in ultrasound with acetone then IPA then DI water.
{{< notice warning >}}
make sure no residual of acetone in the beaker because acetone may react with chloroform and produce explosive compounds.
{{< /notice >}}
2. Dissolve polycarbonate in chloroform, mass ratio 6% (6%~10%), using ultrasound to accelerate the dissolution.
{{< notice warning >}}
must wear a mask when using chloroform because chloroform can generate COCl<sub>2</sub> (10 times toxicity of Cl<sub>2</sub>) 
{{< /notice >}}
3. Clean 3 glass slides with IPA, remove dust.
4. Put a PDMS membrane near the edge of a glass side.
5. Take a piece of double-sided tape and cut out a diamond shape hole at the center. Cover the glass slide with the tape and expose PDMS from the hole.

6. Drop some polycarbonate solution on one glass slide. Use another glass slide to even the PC solution and rotate the slides to separate them.

7. Use double side tape with hole to paste the PC film. Peel out this tape from the glass slide.

8. Stick the tape with PC to the tape with PDMS. The tape sides are face to face. Align the hole to hole.

9. Cut out the outer area of the tape.

10. Fix the glass slide to the holder. Target the hole at a 2D flake.
11. Slowly tune down the glass slide until PC film touch the flake surface. We can see the color change when the contact happens.

12. Heat the sample to 80 â„ƒ for 5 min and then cool down to room temperature.
13. Slowly pick up the glass slide. We can find the disappearance of the target flask on the substrate and when we focus onto the polymer membrane we find the profile of such flake.

14. Target the profile to another flake. Slowly tune down the glass slide until PC touch the sample.

15. Heat up to 170 C for 5 min or longer.
16. Pick up the glass slides first and then cool down the sample.

17. Clean the sample by soaking in chloroform, acetone and IPA
{{< notice warning >}}
Clean up chloroform before using acetone to ensure safety
